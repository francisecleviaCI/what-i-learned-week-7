Mutations: Arrays have methods that, when executed, enable the user to 'mutate' the data in the array. For example, using 
.push or .unshift, you are able to enter data. Using .shift or .pop, you are able to delete data. This is particularly useful
because you don't have to create or delete an existing array. However, it differs from mapping because it affects the number of elements in the array.


Array Mapping: Mapping gives the user the ability to affect the data elements of the array by applying a function to each element. For
example, you can have a function that adds 10 to each element of the array and still keep the number of entries in the original array
the same. 




**Thoughts**
1. In every language learning process, there's a moment when you 'transition', as if you are entering a different phase of comprehension. I'm still waiting for that moment!
